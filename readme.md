### 2. Configure Credentials

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# MongoDB Atlas API Credentials
MONGODB_ATLAS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
MONGODB_ATLAS_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
MONGODB_ATLAS_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
MONGODB_ATLAS_ORG_ID=your_org_id

# OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

**Get MongoDB Atlas API Keys:**
1. Go to MongoDB Atlas ‚Üí Organization Access Manager
2. Create API Key with "Project Read Only" or higher permissions
3. Copy Public Key and Private Key

---

## üèÉ Running the System

### Run Complete Analysis (All 4 Agents)
```bash
python -m ai_latest_development.main
```
or

```bash
source venv/bin/activate && python -m ai_latest_development.main
```

Or using the installed script:
```bash
run_crew
```

### Execution Flow
1. **PerformanceAgent** runs first ‚Üí appends to `report.md`
2. **SecurityAgent** runs second ‚Üí appends to `report.md`
3. **CostAgent** runs third ‚Üí appends to `report.md`
4. **ReportSynthesizer** runs last ‚Üí reads full report, calculates health scores, appends executive summary

### Output
- **File:** `report.md` at project root
- **Sections:**
  1. Header with project info and timestamp
  2. ‚ö° Performance Analysis
  3. üîí Security Audit
  4. üí∞ Cost Optimization Analysis
  5. üìä Executive Summary & Health Assessment

## üìä Health Scoring System

### Overall Health Score (0-100)
Weighted average of three domains:
- **Performance:** 35% weight
- **Security:** 40% weight (most critical)
- **Cost Efficiency:** 25% weight

### Scoring Methodology

#### Performance Score
- **100:** All metrics healthy, no bottlenecks
- **Deductions:**
  - High CPU usage (>75%): -15 points
  - Disk saturation: -10 points
  - Network latency issues: -15 points
  - Missing metrics: -25 points

#### Security Score
- **100:** No vulnerabilities, best practices followed
- **Deductions:**
  - Open IP access (0.0.0.0/0): -30 points (CRITICAL)
  - Overly privileged users: -20 points
  - No encryption at rest: -25 points
  - TLS not enforced: -15 points

#### Cost Efficiency Score
- **100:** Optimal resource utilization, no waste
- **Deductions:**
  - Overprovisioned instances: -20 points
  - Idle/underutilized clusters: -15 points
  - Expensive backup configs: -10 points
  - Unnecessary replicas: -15 points

### Health Ratings
- **90-100:** Excellent ‚úÖ
- **75-89:** Good üëç
- **60-74:** Fair ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **40-59:** Poor üî¥
- **0-39:** Critical üö®

## üîß Architecture Details

### Tools
All tools use **HTTP Digest Authentication** to call MongoDB Atlas Management API:

- `atlas_performance_tool.py` - Fetches clusters, processes, and measurements
- `atlas_security_tool.py` - Fetches IP access lists, users, clusters, encryption config
- `atlas_cost_tool.py` - Combines cluster config + utilization metrics for cost analysis
- `report_synthesis_tool.py` - Parses report.md, calculates scores, correlates findings

### Agent Configuration
Agents are defined in `config/agents.yaml` with:
- Role and goal
- Backstory (persona)
- LLM model: `gpt-4o-mini` (cost-effective, fast)

### Task Configuration
Tasks are defined in `config/tasks.yaml` with:
- Detailed description (what to analyze and how)
- Expected output (format and content requirements)
- Agent assignment

### Crew Orchestration
- **Process:** Sequential (agents run one after another)
- **Callbacks:** Each task appends to `report.md` (no overwriting)
- **Dependencies:** Synthesis task depends on all three analysis tasks
- **Initialization:** `@before_kickoff` creates report header

## üìà Example Findings

### Actual Issues Detected in Sample Run:

#### Security Vulnerabilities ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **CRITICAL:** IP access list contains `0.0.0.0/0` (open to internet)
2. **HIGH:** User `spotmeapp` has `atlasAdmin` role (excessive privileges)
3. **HIGH:** Encryption at rest disabled (no external KMS)

#### Cost Inefficiencies üí∏
1. **M10 instance** potentially oversized for workload
2. **Replication factor 3** = 3x cost (may be unnecessary for dev/test)
3. **Provider backup + PIT enabled** = ~$20-40/month in backup costs
4. **3000 IOPS provisioned** - may exceed actual usage
5. **Autoscaling enabled without min/max limits** - cost unpredictability

**Estimated Monthly Waste:** $150-220/month ($1,800-2,640/year)

#### Performance Issues ‚ö°
1. Unable to retrieve detailed metrics (API permissions or cluster tier limitation)
2. Need Query Profiler enabled to identify slow queries
3. Index coverage analysis recommended
