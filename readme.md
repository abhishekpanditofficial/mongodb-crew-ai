# MongoDB Atlas AI Ops Multi-Agent System

A comprehensive **5-agent CrewAI system** that performs automated analysis of MongoDB Atlas infrastructure across performance, security, cost efficiency, schema design, and generates executive-level consolidated reports with health scoring.

## üéØ System Overview

This multi-agent system analyzes MongoDB Atlas environments and produces AI-driven reports covering:
- **Performance optimization** (CPU, slow queries, cluster sizing, **index recommendations**)
- **Security analysis** (IP access, roles, TLS, encryption)
- **Cost optimization** (overprovisioning, backup costs, idle resources)
- **Schema analysis & data modeling** (collection schemas, relationships, embedding vs referencing)
- **Executive synthesis** (health scoring, prioritization, ROI analysis)

## ‚ú® Latest Enhancement: Index Analysis & Query Optimization

The PerformanceAgent now provides **comprehensive index optimization recommendations** by integrating three powerful analysis methods:

### What's New?
1. **MongoDB Performance Advisor Integration** - Gets AI-powered index suggestions directly from Atlas
2. **Slow Query Analysis** - Identifies queries >100ms with full execution details  
3. **Index Efficiency Scoring** - Calculates scan ratios to detect missing indexes
4. **Ready-to-Execute Commands** - Provides exact `createIndex()` statements

### Example Output
When the agent runs, you'll now get detailed sections like:

**üéØ Index Suggestions:**
- Specific collections that need indexes
- Exact field names and sort orders `{ email: 1, created_at: -1 }`
- Expected query performance improvement (ms saved per query)
- JavaScript commands ready to paste into `mongosh`

**üêå Slow Query Identification:**
- Query patterns causing performance issues
- Execution times and document scan counts
- Which collections are doing full scans

**üìä Efficiency Scoring:**
- Per-process scan ratio analysis (scanned objects / returned docs)
- "Poor/Fair/Good" efficiency ratings
- Quantified impact of missing indexes

> **Note:** Performance Advisor requires M10+ cluster tier. M0/M2 free tiers will show limited data.

## üÜï NEW: Data Compliance & Security Scanning

The **SecurityAgent** now includes **mongodb_compliance_tool** that scans your actual database collections for compliance violations!

### What It Detects:

**1. PII (Personally Identifiable Information):**
- Unencrypted emails, phone numbers, addresses
- Social Security Numbers (regex: `\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}`)
- Passport numbers, national IDs
- Date of birth fields

**2. Sensitive Data Storage:**
- Plaintext passwords (checks if properly hashed)
- API keys, OAuth tokens, JWT tokens
- Private keys, certificates, secrets
- Field names like: `password`, `secret`, `token`, `api_key`

**3. PCI-DSS Violations (CRITICAL):**
- Credit card numbers (regex: `\d{4}[-\s]?\d{4}[-\s]?\d{4}[-\s]?\d{4}`)
- CVV codes, card expiration dates
- Bank account numbers, routing numbers
- **Recommendation:** NEVER store credit cards - use Stripe/PayPal tokenization

**4. HIPAA Violations:**
- Medical records, diagnoses, prescriptions
- Health insurance information
- Patient identifiers without encryption

**5. GDPR Compliance:**
- Missing consent tracking (`consent_date`, `consent_version`)
- No data processing legal basis documented
- Data older than 2 years (retention policy violations)
- Missing "right to erasure" implementation

### Example Violations Found:

```markdown
### Collection: users
**Violation 1: PII Exposure**
- **Field:** `email`
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Issue:** Email addresses stored without field-level encryption
- **Recommendation:** Implement MongoDB field-level encryption or ensure proper access controls
- **Compliance:** GDPR

**Violation 2: Sensitive Data**
- **Field:** `password`
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Issue:** Password field detected - verify it's properly hashed (bcrypt/scrypt)
- **Recommendation:** Ensure passwords use bcrypt with salt rounds ‚â• 12
- **Compliance:** GDPR, PCI-DSS

**Violation 3: GDPR - Missing Consent**
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Issue:** User collection lacks GDPR consent tracking fields
- **Recommendation:** Add fields: `gdpr_consent`, `consent_date`, `consent_version`, `marketing_consent`
- **Compliance:** GDPR
```

### Scan Results Include:
- **Total violations** by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- **Per-collection breakdown** with field names
- **Compliance framework violations** (GDPR: 5, PCI-DSS: 0, HIPAA: 0)
- **Actionable recommendations** (delete, encrypt, hash, tokenize)

## üÜï NEW: Schema Analysis & Data Modeling Agent

The **SchemaAgent** is a powerful addition that directly connects to your MongoDB database to analyze schemas and provide expert data modeling recommendations:

### What It Does:
1. **Discovers Collections** - Automatically finds all collections in your database
2. **Infers Schemas** - Samples 100+ documents per collection to understand data structures
3. **Detects Relationships** - Identifies foreign keys and references between collections
4. **Analyzes Indexes** - Lists existing indexes and flags missing ones
5. **Evaluates Data Models** - Assesses embedding vs referencing patterns
6. **Recommends Optimizations** - Provides 10-15 specific schema improvements

### Key Features:
- **Field Type Analysis:** Detects mixed types, nullability, nested objects, arrays
- **Relationship Mapping:** Creates ASCII diagrams showing collection dependencies
- **Index Recommendations:** Provides exact `createIndex()` commands for performance
- **Embedding vs Referencing:** Advises when to embed (1-to-few) vs reference (1-to-many)
- **Denormalization Strategies:** Identifies read-heavy data that should be duplicated
- **Document Size Analysis:** Flags oversized documents (>5KB) for optimization
- **Migration Plans:** Step-by-step instructions for implementing changes

### Example Recommendations:
```markdown
### Recommendation 1: Missing Index on Foreign Key
**Collection:** `orders`
**Issue:** Field `user_id` is not indexed, causing slow lookups
**Impact:** HIGH - Affects 50,000+ queries per day
**Command:**
```javascript
db.orders.createIndex({ user_id: 1 }, { name: "idx_user_id" });
```

### Recommendation 2: Embedding Opportunity
**Collections:** `users` ‚Üí `addresses`
**Current:** `addresses` is a separate collection with `user_id` reference
**Issue:** 1-to-1 relationship causing unnecessary lookups
**Recommendation:** Embed `addresses` into `users` collection
**Benefit:** Eliminates 10,000+ daily JOIN-like queries, reduces latency by 80%
```

### Configuration:
Set these environment variables in `.env`:
```bash
MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/
MONGODB_DATABASE=your_database_name
```

**Atlas Management API Tools** (use HTTP Digest Authentication):
- `atlas_performance_tool.py` - Fetches clusters, processes, measurements, **Performance Advisor suggestions**, **slow query logs**, and calculates **index efficiency ratios**
- `atlas_security_tool.py` - Fetches IP access lists, users, clusters, encryption config
- `atlas_cost_tool.py` - Combines cluster config + utilization metrics for cost analysis

**Direct MongoDB Connection Tools** (use connection string):
- `mongodb_schema_tool.py` - Connects to MongoDB database, discovers collections, infers schemas, detects relationships, analyzes indexes, recommends data modeling improvements

**Synthesis & Reporting Tools**:
- `report_synthesis_tool.py` - Parses report.md, calculates scores, correlates findings

### üîç Index Analysis Features (PerformanceAgent)

The Performance tool now provides comprehensive index optimization insights:

**1. Performance Advisor Suggested Indexes**
- Queries MongoDB's built-in Performance Advisor API
- Returns specific field names to index
- Includes expected query time savings
- Available on M10+ clusters

**2. Slow Query Logs**
- Identifies queries with >100ms execution time
- Shows query shapes and patterns
- Reports documents examined vs documents returned ratio
- Helps prioritize index creation by impact

**3. Index Efficiency Analysis**
- Calculates scan ratios: `scanned_objects / scanned_docs`
- **Ratio > 10:** Poor efficiency - missing indexes likely
- **Ratio 3-10:** Fair efficiency - review query patterns
- **Ratio < 3:** Good efficiency - indexes being used effectively
- Based on `QUERY_EXECUTOR_SCANNED` and `QUERY_EXECUTOR_SCANNED_OBJECTS` metrics

**Example Output:**
```markdown
### Index Optimization Recommendations

#### Cluster: Cluster0 | Process: cluster0-shard-00-00.mongodb.net:27017

**Suggested Indexes (Performance Advisor):**
- `db.users` - Create index on `{ email: 1, created_at: -1 }` ‚Üí Expected savings: 250ms/query
- `db.orders` - Create index on `{ user_id: 1, status: 1 }` ‚Üí Expected savings: 180ms/query

**Slow Queries Detected:**
- `db.users.find({ email: "..." }).sort({ created_at: -1 })` - 312ms avg execution time
- Examined: 125,000 docs | Returned: 1 doc | Scan Ratio: 125,000x

**Index Efficiency:**
- Scan Ratio: 45.2 (Poor - Missing indexes likely)
- Average Scanned Objects: 45,203
- Average Scanned Docs: 1,000

**Ready-to-Execute Commands:**
```javascript
db.users.createIndex({ email: 1, created_at: -1 }, { name: "idx_email_created" });
db.orders.createIndex({ user_id: 1, status: 1 }, { name: "idx_user_status" });
```
```

**Note:** Performance Advisor and slow query logs require:
- M10+ cluster tier (not available on M0/M2 free/shared tiers)
- Database profiling enabled (Atlas enables this automatically on M10+)
- Sufficient query history for analysis

### Agent Configuration
Agents are defined in `config/agents.yaml` with:
- Role and goal
- Backstory (persona)
- LLM model: `gpt-4o-mini` (cost-effective, fast)

### Task Configuration
Tasks are defined in `config/tasks.yaml` with:
- Detailed description (what to analyze and how)
- Expected output (format and content requirements)
- Agent assignment

### Crew Orchestration
- **Process:** Sequential (agents run one after another)
- **Callbacks:** Each task appends to `report.md` (no overwriting)
- **Dependencies:** Synthesis task depends on all three analysis tasks
- **Initialization:** `@before_kickoff` creates report header

---

## üìà Example Findings

### Actual Issues Detected in Sample Run:

#### Security Vulnerabilities ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **CRITICAL:** IP access list contains `0.0.0.0/0` (open to internet)
2. **HIGH:** User `spotmeapp` has `atlasAdmin` role (excessive privileges)
3. **HIGH:** Encryption at rest disabled (no external KMS)

#### Cost Inefficiencies üí∏
1. **M10 instance** potentially oversized for workload
2. **Replication factor 3** = 3x cost (may be unnecessary for dev/test)
3. **Provider backup + PIT enabled** = ~$20-40/month in backup costs
4. **3000 IOPS provisioned** - may exceed actual usage
5. **Autoscaling enabled without min/max limits** - cost unpredictability

**Estimated Monthly Waste:** $150-220/month ($1,800-2,640/year)

#### Performance Issues ‚ö°
1. Unable to retrieve detailed metrics (API permissions or cluster tier limitation)
2. Need Query Profiler enabled to identify slow queries
3. Index coverage analysis recommended
