## INDEX OPTIMIZATION SECTION

### Suggested Indexes:
1. **Namespace**: `casapadel_prod.bookings`
   - Suggested Index: `{ conversation: 1 }`
   - Average Query Execution Time Saved: 50ms

2. **Namespace**: `casapadel_prod.conversationmaps`
   - Suggested Index: `{ conversation: 1, user: 1 }`
   - Average Query Execution Time Saved: 60ms
   
### Slow Queries:
1. **Namespace**: `casapadel_prod.transactions`
   - Execution Time: 120ms
   - Query Shape: `{ "filter": { "status": "completed" } }`
   - Documents Examined: 1000
   - Documents Returned: 150

2. **Namespace**: `casapadel_prod.customerusers`
   - Execution Time: 110ms
   - Query Shape: `{ "name": { "$regex": "John" } }`
   - Documents Examined: 500
   - Documents Returned: 50

### Index Efficiency Ratios:
- Ratio for `bookings`: 12 (poor/missing indexes - requires attention)
- Ratio for `conversationmaps`: 9 (fair)

### Create Index Commands:
```javascript
db.bookings.createIndex({ conversation: 1 })
db.conversationmaps.createIndex({ conversation: 1, user: 1 })
```

## Critical Issues
- Increased slow query time impacting the performance of casapadel-production-cluster-v2.
- Lack of efficient indexing leading to longer query execution times.

## Optimization Recommendations
1. Implement the suggested indexes on `bookings` and `conversationmaps` collections to improve query performance.
2. Regularly analyze slow queries and prioritize creating indexes based on execution times.
3. Limit connections by optimizing connection pooling configuration in application settings.
4. Review query shapes for potential optimizations such as rewriting to be more efficient.
5. Schedule maintenance windows for enhanced monitoring and performance tuning.
6. Implement a caching solution to reduce load on the database by caching frequently accessed data.
7. Use monitoring tools to alert on high CPU and memory usage metrics to address performance degradation proactively.
8. Engage in automated testing of query performance after indices have been applied, ensuring improvements.
9. Scale up the instance size of casapadel-production-cluster-v2 if performance issues persist after optimizations.
10. Consider sharding the largest collections if they threaten to exceed the limits of resources available within current instances.

With these optimizations in place, the clusters should exhibit improved performance and resource utilization.

## 🔒 Security Audit


# Comprehensive Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary
The current security posture of the MongoDB Atlas infrastructure and data compliance in the project is rated **High Risk**. The vulnerability detection using the **atlas_security_tool** showed improper IP whitelisting practices and the potential for configuration changes to enhance security measures. The **mongodb_compliance_tool** identified 69 data compliance violations, with critical exposures related to PII and sensitive data mishandlings. Immediate action is necessary to remediate identified vulnerabilities and to enhance compliance with GDPR, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA frameworks.

## Infrastructure Security Findings
### Atlas Configuration Vulnerabilities
1. **IP Access List**:
   - **Open Ranges Detected**: 
     - `0.0.0.0/0` (Width: Very broad, Risk Level: Critical)
     - Recommendation: Restrict to known IP addresses only to minimize exposure.
  
2. **Database Users & Roles**:
   - **Users with Excessive Privileges**:
     - Users `wekancasapadel`, `developer`, `satnam`, and `neha` all have `readWriteAnyDatabase` roles which may not be necessary for their functions.
     - Recommendation: Review user access rights to limit privilege escalation risks.

3. **TLS Configuration**:
   - Minimum TLS Version: `TLS1_2` is enforced, which is compliant.
   - Connection string is secure, using SSL.
  
4. **Encryption at Rest**:
   - Not enabled; utilizing default configurations.
   - Recommendation: Enable encryption at rest with customer-managed keys (KMS) where applicable.

5. **Network Security**:
   - No VPC peering or private endpoints utilized, exposing clusters to public access.
   - Recommendation: Implement private endpoints to reduce attack vectors.

6. **Authentication Methods**:
   - No advanced authentication options like LDAP or SCRAM being implemented, potentially opening avenues for unauthorized access.
   - Recommendation: Review and enforce stricter authentication methods. 

## DATA COMPLIANCE VIOLATIONS

### Violation Counts by Severity
- **Critical Violations**: 3
- **High Risk Violations**: 58
- **Medium Risk Violations**: 8
- **Low Risk Violations**: 0

### Per-Collection Breakdown of Violations
1. **consolidatedusers**
   - Field: `email`, Severity: High, Issue: PII exposure.
   - Field: `phone`, Severity: High, Issue: PII exposure.

### GDPR Violations
- Missing consent tracking fields across key collections _(consolidatedusers, customerusers)_, totaling 4 key recommendations to align with GDPR compliance.

### Additional Detected Issues
- **Sensitive Data** exposure in logs (API keys, JWT, etc.) across collections such as `webhook_event_logs`, `payment_method_logs`.
  
## Compliance Framework Summary
- **GDPR Violations**: 30 total violations across collections.
- **PCI-DSS Violations**: 3 critical violations regarding sensitive data storage.

[consumed books] ----- [feeditemcomments] ------> [feeds]
```
The diagram above illustrates relationships, but circular references are not detected.

## Data Modeling Analysis
Based on the findings:
1. **Embedding vs Referencing**
   - Fields like `participants` in `bookings` and `logs` can be embedded if often accessed.
   - Collections like `feeditemcomments` and `feeds` could benefit from embedding to reduce the complexity of queries.

2. **Denormalization Opportunities**
   - There is frequent joining on `participants` needing possible denormalization in collections with high document counts.

3. **Schema Optimization**
   - Collections like `bookingavailables` should be evaluated for split according to size.

4. **Index Strategy**
   - Missing indexes on frequently queried fields are observed in `bookings`, `users`, and `notifications`.

## Index Recommendations
- **Create Index for `logs` collection**:
  ```javascript
  db.logs.createIndex({ "userId": 1 })
  ```
- **Create Index for `bookingavailables` collection**:
  ```javascript
  db.bookingavailables.createIndex({ "club": 1, "date": 1 })
  ```

## Schema Refactoring Recommendations
1.  **Consolidate duplicated fields** and prioritize embedding over referencing for less than 100 related documents.
2. **Split oversized documents** to comply with MongoDB's document size limitations.
3. **Implement missing compound indexes** on frequent query paths.
4. **Remove redundant indexes** to enhance write performance.
5. **Optimize document structure** by having common fields available directly under user profiles to reduce deeply nested queries.
6. **Monitor read/write operations** for usage patterns to determine further optimization needs.
7. **Evaluate schema versioning strategies** to manage changes as the application evolves.
8. **Setup aggregation pipelines** to automate reporting from logs and transactions.

## Migration Plan
1. **Implement indexes first** to ensure existing queries perform better.
2. **Refactor documents based on recommendations**, prioritize high-impact collections.
3. **Test changes on a staging environment**.
4. **Plan for rolling back changes**, if necessary, during maintenance windows.

## Code Examples
```javascript
// Example: Creating an index for bookings based on the value of club and date
db.bookings.createIndex({ "club": 1, "date": -1 });

// Example: Query simplification using aggregation
db.bookings.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "customers",
      localField: "customerId",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "customerDetails"
    }
  }
]);

// Example: Find high total slots records
db.bookingavailables.find({"totalSlots": {$gt: 100}}).pretty();
```

This analysis should facilitate improving the current MongoDB schema and align it more closely with fire-engineering standards, ultimately enhancing application performance and reliability.
