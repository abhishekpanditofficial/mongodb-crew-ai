- The `files` collection, while not excessively large, may still present optimization opportunities due to its increasing document count.

## Schema Details By Collection

### Files Collection
- **Fields**:
  - `_id`: ObjectId (not nullable)
  - `user`: string (not nullable)
  - `file`: string (not nullable)
  - `cdnLink`: string (not nullable)
  - `createdAt`: datetime (not nullable)
  - `updatedAt`: datetime (not nullable)
  - `__v`: int (not nullable)

### Users Collection
- **Fields**:
  - `_id`: ObjectId (not nullable)
  - `email`: string (not nullable)
  - `firstName`: string (not nullable)
  - `lastName`: string (nullable)
  - `blurredImage`: string (not nullable)
  - `profilePhoto`: object (contains paths and IDs)

## Data Modeling Analysis
- **Embedding vs. Referencing**:
  - **Embed**: Small collections or 1-to-1 or 1-to-few relationships, such as user profiles and their settings.
  - **Reference**: Collections with potential for high cardinality such as `posts` and `compliments` should keep references to minimize duplication.

## Index Optimization
- **Missing Index Recommendations**:
  1. Create index on `userIds` in `campaigns` to optimize queries.
  2. Create index on `postId` in `compliments`.
  
```python
db.campaigns.createIndex({ "userIds": 1 })
db.compliments.createIndex({ "postId": 1 })
```

## Schema Refactoring Recommendations
1. **Optimize indexing** for users by adding an index on email to speed up login queries.
2. **Review the users collection** for potential fields that could be embedded based on less frequent updates.
3. **Split large configurations collection** if certain settings are rarely updated.
4. **Remove or adjust unused fields** from profiles within users to normalize the document.
5. **Monitor document sizes** of `superlikes` and `leaderboards` for potential splitting.

## Migration Plan
1. **Create necessary indexes** as outlined.
2. **Review users and related schema** for logical reorganization if necessary.
3. **Test queries with index implementation** to confirm improvements in performance.

## Code Examples
### Adding Indexes
```python
db.campaigns.createIndex({ "userIds": 1 })
db.compliments.createIndex({ "postId": 1 })
db.boostmessages.createIndex({ "boostId": 1 })
db.viewrequests.createIndex({ "postId": 1 })
```

This analysis produces immediate actionable insights that can be implemented to improve performance, reduce complexity, and enhance data integrity moving forward. Regular monitoring and reviews should be scheduled to stay ahead of potential issues as the database evolves.
