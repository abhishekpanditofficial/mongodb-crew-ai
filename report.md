# MongoDB Atlas Performance Analysis Report

## Cluster Performance Findings

### Cluster: `spotme`
- **CPU Usage**: Unable to retrieve metrics, thus cannot assess if CPU usage exceeds 75%.
- **Disk IOPS**: Unable to retrieve metrics, therefore unclear if IOPS exceeds 1000.
- **Network Utilization**: Unable to retrieve metrics, so network input/output utilization is unknown.
- **Command Ops**: Unable to retrieve metrics, thus information on command operations per second remains unavailable.

### Process Performance Findings
- **Process**: `atlas-fnkdul-shard-00-00.z4ebs.mongodb.net`
  - **CPU Usage**: Unable to retrieve metrics.
  - **Disk IOPS**: Unable to retrieve metrics.
  - **Network Utilization**: Unable to retrieve metrics.
  - **Command Ops**: Unable to retrieve metrics.

- **Process**: `atlas-fnkdul-shard-00-01.z4ebs.mongodb.net`
  - **CPU Usage**: Unable to retrieve metrics.
  - **Disk IOPS**: Unable to retrieve metrics.
  - **Network Utilization**: Unable to retrieve metrics. 
  - **Command Ops**: Unable to retrieve metrics.

- **Process**: `atlas-fnkdul-shard-00-02.z4ebs.mongodb.net`
  - **CPU Usage**: Unable to retrieve metrics.
  - **Disk IOPS**: Unable to retrieve metrics.
  - **Network Utilization**: Unable to retrieve metrics.
  - **Command Ops**: Unable to retrieve metrics.

## Summary
Due to consistent errors in fetching metrics, I have been unable to assess the performance of the MongoDB clusters accurately. This report lacks critical insights regarding CPU usage, disk IOPS, network utilization, and command operation counts.

## Recommendations
1. **Check API Status**: Monitor MongoDB Atlas' API status for any ongoing issues that may affect data retrieval.
2. **Verify Permissions**: Ensure the correct permissions are set for accessing cluster metrics.
3. **Inspect Network Configuration**: Look into any network configurations or firewalls that might block API calls from being processed correctly.
4. **Retry Metrics Retrieval**: Attempt to retrieve metrics again at a later time, as the issues may be temporary.
5. **Contact Support**: If persistent issues occur, contacting MongoDB support for assistance on metric retrieval could provide clarity on any underlying problems.
