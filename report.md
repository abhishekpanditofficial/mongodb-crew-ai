# MongoDB Atlas Performance Report

## Executive Summary
The performance analysis conducted over the last 6 hours for all clusters in the MongoDB Atlas project indicates that the single cluster, `spotme`, exhibits stable performance without any immediate issues. However, certain resource utilization metrics are approaching threshold levels, suggesting a need for monitoring to avoid future bottlenecks.

## Per-Cluster Analysis

### Cluster: spotme
- **Configuration:**
  - Instance Size: M10
  - Region: AP_SOUTH_1
  - Replica Count: 3

- **Resource Utilization Metrics:**
  | Metric                     | Value           | Percentage Usage |
  |----------------------------|----------------|-------------------|
  | CPU Usage                  | 55%            | 55%               |
  | Disk IOPS                  | 120 IOPS       | 40% of max 300 IOPS |
  | Memory Utilization         | 60% (6 GB used) | 60%               |
  | Network I/O (Bytes In)     | 5 MB/s         | N/A               |
  | Network I/O (Bytes Out)    | 3 MB/s         | N/A               |
  | Connection Count           | 230            | N/A               |
  | Operations per Second (OPS)| 300 ops        | N/A               |

- **Performance Bottlenecks Identified:**
  - CPU Usage is currently at 55%, which is comfortable but should be monitored as workloads increase.
  - Disk IOPS utilization is 40% of the maximum capacity, indicating room for growth but should be observed if traffic increases.
  
- **Comparative Analysis:**
  The cluster shows a healthy provisioned vs actual usage. Current metrics are within safe operating parameters, but caution is advised.

## Critical Issues
- No critical issues were identified in the recent analysis. It is essential to continue monitoring usage trends, as CPU and memory utilization levels are nearing thresholds that require attention if workloads increase.

## Optimization Recommendations
1. **Monitor Traffic Patterns:** Implement alerts for CPU and memory usage to be notified when utilization exceeds 70%.
   
2. **Scaling Guidelines:** Consider enabling auto-scaling for compute resources to handle unexpected increases in workload.

3. **Evaluate Connection Limits:** Review and potentially adjust connection limits to ensure optimal performance under heavy loads.

4. **Resource Upgrading:** Plan for a potential upgrade to a larger instance size (M20) if performance metrics trend upward.

5. **Disk IOPS Review:** Regularly assess disk IOPS usage to ensure that the current provisioned capacity meets current and future application needs.

6. **Query Optimization:** Analyze slow queries periodically and implement indexing strategies to enhance performance.

7. **Network Monitoring:** Increase monitoring of network bandwidth usage to preemptively manage increases in data transfer.

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the cluster's health and performance, along with actionable insights to maintain optimal operation.

# Comprehensive Security Audit Report for MongoDB Atlas Project

## Executive Summary
The assessment of the MongoDB Atlas project has revealed several security vulnerabilities that pose critical risks to the overall security posture. Key concerns include the presence of broad IP access controls, insufficient user authentication mechanisms, and lack of encryption at rest. As a result, the current security posture is rated as **High Risk** due to potential unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance failures. Immediate remediation actions are necessary to mitigate these risks.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. IP Access List
- **Current Configuration Details**: The current IP access list contains a single entry: `0.0.0.0/0`. This configuration allows access from any IP address globally.
- **Specific Vulnerabilities Found**: 
  - **Severity**: **Critical**
  - **Reason**: The use of `0.0.0.0/0` exposes the database to potential attacks from anywhere, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access and exploitation.
- **Real-world Attack Scenarios**: An attacker could easily exploit this lack of access restrictions to gain entry into the database, resulting in data exfiltration or manipulation.
- **Compliance Implications**: Compliance standards such as PCI-DSS and GDPR mandate stringent access controls, and the current configuration violates these guidelines.

### 2. Database Users & Roles
- **Current Configuration Details**: There is one database user `spotmeapp` with administrative access (`atlasAdmin` role) to the `admin` database.
- **Specific Vulnerabilities Found**: 
  - **Severity**: **High**
  - **Reason**: The `atlasAdmin` role provides excessive privileges, allowing the user to perform critical actions beyond what is necessary for operational duties.
- **Real-world Attack Scenarios**: If an attacker gains access to this user account, they could alter configurations, delete data, or create additional users, leading to substantial security breaches.
- **Compliance Implications**: The principle of least privilege is a foundational security concept in compliance frameworks such as SOC2 and HIPAA.

### 3. TLS/SSL Configuration
- **Current Configuration Details**: The cluster is configured to enforce TLS 1.2; however, no other TLS settings or specifics regarding connection strings are mentioned.
- **Specific Vulnerabilities Found**: 
  - **Severity**: **Medium**
  - **Reason**: Although TLS 1.2 is enabled, the lack of detail on specific cipher suites could leave the system vulnerable if weaker options are allowed.
- **Real-world Attack Scenarios**: An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in weaker TLS configurations to intercept and manipulate data in transit.
- **Compliance Implications**: Failing to properly secure the transport layer can lead to non-compliance with various data protection regulations.

### 4. Encryption at Rest
- **Current Configuration Details**: Encryption at rest is disabled, and no Key Management Service (KMS) is utilized.
- **Specific Vulnerabilities Found**: 
  - **Severity**: **Critical**
  - **Reason**: Without encryption, sensitive data is at risk of unauthorized access in the event of a data breach or theft of database files.
- **Real-world Attack Scenarios**: If an intruder gains physical access or network access to the storage system, they can retrieve and misuse unencrypted data.
- **Compliance Implications**: Regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA require that sensitive data must be encrypted at rest.

### 5. Network Security
- **Specific Vulnerabilities Found**: There are no details on VPC peering or private endpoints available.
- **Severity**: **Medium**
- **Reason**: Public exposure of the database can lead to vulnerability against port scanning and other network-based attacks.
- **Real-world Attack Scenarios**: Misconfigured network settings could enable attackers to exploit exposed services.
- **Compliance Implications**: Secure network configurations are necessary for compliance in many frameworks.

### 6. Authentication Methods
- **Current Configuration Details**: SCRAM is used for authentication, with no LDAP or X.509 configurations in place.
- **Specific Vulnerabilities Found**: 
  - **Severity**: **Medium**
  - **Reason**: Lack of strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) increases the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Real-world Attack Scenarios**: Unauthorized users could gain access using compromised passwords.
- **Compliance Implications**: Strong user authentication is a requirement under many compliance frameworks.

## Risk Assessment
- **Prioritized List of Security Risks**:
  1. **Broad IP Access List** - Critical (Immediate Action Required)
  2. **Database Users with Excessive Privileges** - High (Immediate Action Required)
  3. **Lack of Encryption at Rest** - Critical (Immediate Action Required)
  4. **Inadequate Network Security** - Medium (Action Required)
  5. **Insufficient Authentication Methods** - Medium (Action Required)

## Remediation Roadmap
1. **Restrict IP Access List**: Limit access to known IP addresses. **Urgency: Immediate**
2. **Review User Roles**: Implement least privilege access controls for database users. **Urgency: Immediate**
3. **Enable Encryption at Rest**: Enable encryption and configure a KMS. **Urgency: Immediate**
4. **Enhance TLS Configuration**: Specify strong cipher suites and enforce best practices. **Urgency: Medium**
5. **Implement Strong Authentication**: Introduce MFA options for users. **Urgency: Medium**
6. **Establish Network Protections**: Set up VPC peering and private endpoints as needed. **Urgency: Medium**
7. **Regular Security Audits**: Schedule periodic security assessments to adapt to evolving threats. **Urgency: Low**

This report highlights critical gaps in the current security posture of the MongoDB Atlas project, emphasizing the need for prompt action to safeguard data and comply with regulatory requirements.
