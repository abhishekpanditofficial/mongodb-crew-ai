## 🔒 Security Audit

```
# MongoDB Atlas Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary
This audit report evaluates the security posture of the MongoDB Atlas project identified as **spotme**. The current analysis highlights significant vulnerabilities in both infrastructure and data compliance, categorizing the overall risk as **High**. Inadequate access controls and unencrypted sensitive data pose serious threats to the security and compliance status of the database.

## Infrastructure Security Findings
1. **IP Access List**: The configuration allows access from `0.0.0.0/0`, indicating that the database is openly accessible from any IP. This is a critical security risk and needs immediate remediation.
   
2. **Database Users & Roles**: The current user, **spotmeapp**, is assigned the role of `atlasAdmin` for the `admin` database, which provides extensive control. This elevated privilege can lead to privilege escalation and should be reviewed for appropriateness based on the principle of least privilege.
   
3. **TLS/SSL Configuration**: The cluster enforces TLS 1.2, which is compliant with current security standards. However, connection strings should ensure that applications are set to enforce TLS settings consistently.
   
4. **Encryption at Rest**: There is no encryption enabled for data at rest. The absence of this security measure increases the risk of unauthorized access to stored data. External key management systems (KMS) are not integrated.
   
5. **Network Security**: The project does not seem to implement VPC peering or private endpoints, permitting public exposure of the database which could attract malicious activity.
   
6. **Authentication Methods**: The authentication method is primarily reliant on username/password (SCRAM) without any secondary verification method (e.g., X.509). This requires enhancement to mitigate unauthorized access.
