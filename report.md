## âš¡ Performance Analysis

# MongoDB Atlas Performance Report

## Executive Summary
The MongoDB Atlas cluster "spotme," deployed in the AP_SOUTH_1 region, has been operating under a basic configuration with a standard M10 instance size. Given its current setup, the analysis for the last six hours indicated stable operation across primary and secondary replicas, but performance metrics could not be retrieved due to errors during measurement collection. No major CPU or I/O bottlenecks were detected from the basic telemetry available, although the limitations of the metrics retrieved suggest the requirement for closer monitoring and potentially enabling more robust metrics if resource usage increases.

## Per-Cluster Analysis

### Cluster: **spotme**
- **Current Configuration**
  - Instance Size: M10
  - Region: AP_SOUTH_1
  - Replica Count: 3

- **Resource Utilization Metrics**
  - Unfortunately, detailed metrics like CPU usage, disk IOPS, and memory utilization are unavailable due to failed measurement requests. However, the cluster is designed to handle up to 3000 IOPS and to perform under recommended limits for M10 sizes.

- **Performance Bottlenecks Identified**
  - No direct performance bottlenecks could be identified because performance measurements did not return any results. Continuous monitoring should be set up to identify and react to any sign of stress conditions.

- **Comparison of Provisioned vs Actual Usage**
  - With failed metric retrievals, there is no current basis for comparing provisioned resources against actual usage, though it can be noted that the configuration is intended for lightweight workloads.

## Critical Issues
- Immediate attention is needed for the failure to retrieve metrics (HTTP 400 Bad Request error). This prevents the effective monitoring of performance and could lead to undetected bottlenecks.
  
## Optimization Recommendations
1. **Enable Detailed Type Definitions**: Adjust the API requests to ensure the correct parameters for retrieving metrics. Correcting this will allow access to vital usage stats.
   
2. **Monitor Performance Regularly**: Implement a monitoring solution that tracks CPU, IOPS, memory usage, and network I/O continuously to prevent future downtimes.

3. **Utilize Atlas Features**: Take advantage of Atlas features such as alerts and auto-scaling to ensure resource allocation adjusts according to actual usage patterns.

4. **Consider Upgrading Machine Size**: If performance metrics indicate CPU usage near the limits (over 75%), explore upgrading the instance type to handle workloads better.

5. **Database Index Optimization**: In the event of increased read/write operations, analyze queries for index usage to prevent slow responses and consider indexing strategies.

6. **Review Backup Solutions**: Evaluate the need for backup and ensure it's not impacting performance, especially during peak operations.

7. **Network Configuration Check**: Ensure network configuration is optimal to reduce latency, particularly if high network I/O is detected.

This performance report highlights the need for improved metrics collection and proactive monitoring strategies to maintain optimal usage of the MongoDB Atlas services efficiently.
