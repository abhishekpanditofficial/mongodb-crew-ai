performance_task:
  description: >
    Using the atlas_performance_tool, fetch clusters and 6-hour measurements for CPU, disk IOPS,
    network bytes in/out, and command ops. Detect high CPU (>75% avg), high IOPS (>1000 max), low
    utilization (low net in <10k avg or low ops <50 avg), and high egress (>10,000,000 avg out).
    Produce a concise Markdown section per cluster/process with bullet insights and a closing list
    of general recommendations.
